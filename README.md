# MF Development Session

## Required software for local development:
- NodeJS and NPM : https://nodejs.org/en/
- n (node version manager) : ```npm install -g n``` see https://www.npmjs.com/package/n
- Visual Code Studio : https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Step-by-step
1. Fork/clone this repo

2. cd into the cloned directory

3. In your terminal, install the npm modules: 
``` npm install ```
- make sure you are using a relatively recent version of node, LTE is 14.x.x, you can type node -version to find your current version. I would recommend using n to manage your node version: see https://www.npmjs.com/package/n
- make sure you have a .gitignore file which includes node_modules

4. Run ```npm update``` to get updates
